# Iasm
Interpreted assembly-like language written in rust.

This was a simple test to see if I could apply my rust knowledge to something "useful". I haven't done research into how interpreters work, nor have I done research in how assembly typically works. 

Realistically, this is a poorly written while loop that takes a list of commands. But it has taught me a lot about rust. 

I hope you can have fun prodding around this hopefully turing-complete "language".

## A note on version history
I only started using git properly mid-way through the project, so the version history for this project has sadly been lost.

## Upcoming features
I hope to finally finish file I/O, meaning you won't have to hard-code the program in the `open` function.

Then I will leave the project for a while to focus on other small projects, before finally coming back to clean it up. There is a lot of poor code in here and a lot of repetition which will have to be rewritten.
