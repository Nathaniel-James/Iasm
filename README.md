# Iasm
Interpreted assembly-like language written in rust.

This was a simple test to see if I could apply my rust knowledge to something "useful". I haven't done research into how interpreters work, nor have I done research in how assembly typically works. 

Realistically, this is a poorly written while loop that takes a list of commands.
